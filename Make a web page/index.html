    HTML
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p> HTML is main documents type of web, which stands for<b><em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em></b> <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-ud000/l-4185478836/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a> introduces more information about HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type of elements in HTML is defined by <b>tags</b>. Some tags accept additional values called <em><b>attributes</b></em>. They provide additional information to the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the tags can be divided into two types, one is <em>inline</em>, the other is <em>block</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computers are stupid, so we must obey the rules or big problem will be made.

    <b>Creating a Structured Document with HTML</b>
  </h3>
  
  <div>
    <p>
      Browsers like Chrome have <b>developer tools</b>, it can be used to explore the web pages you are visiting. And you can make any change to the website, then return to origin by freshing the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. 'div' is usually used to create boxes for elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      "div", which will occupy specific rectangle area. "span" just use for text decoration and is inline element.
      "div" can have "class", "id" like "d class = '' id = '' " , they can function similar, but not recommend for mix using them. href can be used to reference 'id' like href = "#id" 
      "P" tag has attributes like line height, margin, etc.
      In CSS, tag{}, .class{} and #id{}.
    </p>
  </div>

      <b>Why coding style is important?</b>
      1.Write and understand more efficient.
      2.Communicate in a common style.
      3.Increase productivity

  	What is CSS?
  </h3>
  	<div id="css">
  		<div class="cssimage">
  			CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. If you want to write CSS that makes all h1 elements have a black background and white text, you would write:
  		</div>
  		<div>
  			<img src="cssexample.png" alt="css examle" class="cssimage">
  		</div>
  	</div>
  		<div id="cssexample">
  			In this example, the h1 is a <b>selector</b>. It says to the browser "I want you to apply the rules I'm about to tell you to every h1 element." After the h1 there is a left curly brace { and at the bottom there is a matching right curly brace }. Everything between these curly braces will be interpreted as a "rule" that should be applied to every h1 element.
  		</div>
  		<div>
  			<p><b>Rule:</b> a line of CSS code describing the value that a certain attribute should take.</p> 
  			<p><b>Property:</b> The property you want to change. </p> 
  			<p><b>Value:</b> The value that you want to assign to the attribute. </p>
  			<p><b>Selector:</b> The name that you use to in order to target the elements that are assigned to a class or id attribute in the HTML. </p>
  			<p><b>Class:</b> A class refers to a group of elements that can be styled together. Class names should not contain periods or any other punctuation marks such as class="1.1".</p>
  			<p><b>ID: </b>ID's are unique identifiers that uniquely identifies an element in HTML.</p> 
  		</div>

  	Adding Image
  </h3>
  	<div>
  		Use tag, "img", and two atrributes, "src" for source and "alt" for alternative if the image cannot display.
  	</div>
  <h3 class="subtitle" id="sub5">
  	Box Sizing & Positioning
  </h3>
  	<div>
  		<p>1.HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.</p>
		  <p>2.Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.</p>
		  <p>3.There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.</p>
		  <p>4.Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.</p>
		  <p>5.Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.</p>
		<div>
			<img src="borderset.png" alt="how to set border" class="borderset">
		</div>
		<p>Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.</p>
		<p>Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</p>

  	Code, Test, Refine
  </h3>
  	<div>
  		<p>This is an iterative process, the <b>developer tools</b> of browser can be very helpful for test and refine. </p>
      <p>
        After finishing coding, websites can be used to validate <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">HTML</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">css</a>.
